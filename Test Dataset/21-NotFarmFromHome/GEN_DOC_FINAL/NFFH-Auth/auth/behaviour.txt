### Service Purpose

The 'auth' service is a critical component of the Not Far(m) From Home platform, responsible for managing all aspects of authentication and token management for users and agricultural companies. Its primary purpose is to enable secure access to the platform, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with the system, whether they are browsing, adding to cart, or managing their inventories. The service supports the platform's aim of facilitating direct interactions between local farmers and consumers by ensuring that these interactions are authenticated, thus maintaining a secure and trustworthy environment. It handles the essential functions of user registration, login, and session management through token-based authentication mechanisms.

### Key Features

User Authentication: The service provides endpoints for user login and signup. These processes are handled using POST requests, where users submit credentials (username, email, password) and receive a token if authenticated successfully​​.
Token Management: Leveraging the PyJWT library, the service issues and verifies JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This is vital for maintaining user sessions and ensuring that users do not have to re-enter their credentials with every session refresh, aligning with user stories where maintaining login sessions is crucial​​.
Secure Password Handling: Utilizing the Cryptography library, the service ensures that all user passwords are encrypted before storage, providing robust security against unauthorized access​​.
Session Persistence: The service uses tokens to manage sessions, which supports persistent logins across sessions, addressing user needs for convenience without compromising security​​​​.
Role-Based Access: The service supports different roles (e.g., clients, agricultural companies, administrators) and manages their credentials and session tokens accordingly, thus facilitating a differentiated access control system tailored to the needs of each user group​​.
