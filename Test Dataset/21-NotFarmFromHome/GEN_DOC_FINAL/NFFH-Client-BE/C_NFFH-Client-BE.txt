### **Container:** NFFH-Client-BE

### Container Purpose
The NFFH-Client-BE container is a fundamental component of the "Not Far(m) From Home" platform, which aims to connect consumers directly with local agricultural producers. This container is crucial for handling the backend processes related to user interaction, particularly focusing on user authentication, session management, and customer data handling. It hosts two primary services: the 'client-be' service and the 'mysql-client' service. The 'client-be' service, built on Java and Spring Boot, ensures robust and secure communication between users and the system, enabling features like registration, login, and user data retrieval. Meanwhile, the 'mysql-client' service manages the database operations, storing and retrieving data necessary for maintaining user profiles and interactions securely. This setup directly supports the platform's goal to provide a seamless and secure user experience, fostering local commerce and community engagement through technology.  

### Services Interaction
Within the NFFH-Client-BE container, the interaction between the 'client-be' and 'mysql-client' services is pivotal for the platform's operation. The 'client-be' service handles user-facing functionalities like authentication, session management, and CRUD operations on customer data, crucial for a personalized user experience. It leverages Java and Spring Boot for secure and efficient processing, and interacts directly with the MySQL database managed by the 'mysql-client' service. This database service uses ORM with Hibernate to ensure that data transactions are handled efficiently and securely. The combination of these services within the container enables the platform to manage vast amounts of user data securely and provide continuity in user sessions. Moreover, the services' design adheres to user stories requirements, such as secure login and session persistence, thus supporting the platformâ€™s direct interaction model between consumers and local producers. The container's services thus form a robust backend system that upholds data integrity and security while enhancing user engagement with the platform.
