### **Service:** admin-fe 

### Service Purpose:
The 'admin-fe' service serves as the front-end interface for the administrators of the Not Far(m) From Home platform. This platform aims to facilitate direct interactions between local farmers and consumers, focusing on local produce and streamlined logistics for pickup at agricultural companies. The 'admin-fe' service provides a user-friendly, web-based dashboard that enables administrators to efficiently manage platform activities. This includes monitoring user registrations, managing agricultural company profiles, overseeing inventory updates, and analyzing order processing to ensure the platform operates effectively and securely. The service’s design supports the high-level administrative activities necessary for maintaining the operational integrity of the platform, ensuring compliance with security and data handling standards, and facilitating real-time data access and decision-making capabilities for platform administrators.

### Key Features:
User and Order Management: View, modify, and delete user profiles, along with monitoring and analyzing order details, which are crucial for understanding platform usage patterns and user engagement.
Agricultural Company Oversight: Add, modify, and delete agricultural company profiles, ensuring that the listings are up-to-date and accurate. This is vital for maintaining the credibility and reliability of the platform.
Product Management: Administrators can manage product listings across different sellers, including adding new products, modifying existing ones, and deleting outdated or incorrect listings, ensuring the marketplace remains current and relevant.
Real-Time Updates: Leveraging Angular’s dynamic content delivery capabilities, the service ensures that all data displayed is up-to-date, facilitating immediate action on issues or updates as they occur.
Security and Access Control: Ensures that administrators can manage their login credentials securely, with features supporting secure session management and access controls tailored for administrative functions.

### Programming Language, Frameworks, and Libraries:
The 'admin-fe' service is developed using Node.js, specifically version 18, as indicated by the base image in the Dockerfile. It employs Angular as the front-end framework, which is a robust platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. The dependencies and project build are managed with npm, highlighting a modern JavaScript environment. The service is containerized using Docker, leveraging nginx for serving the compiled Angular static files, ensuring efficient delivery of content to clients.

### Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns:
The service uses a multi-stage Docker build process to create a lightweight production image. Initially, a Node.js image is used to install dependencies and build the Angular application. Following this, an nginx image is employed to serve the static files, resulting in reduced container size and improved security by minimizing the attack surface. The use of Docker Compose facilitates the configuration and deployment of the service by defining build contexts and setting up necessary arguments and port mappings.

### Analysis of the Communication with the Database:
The 'admin-fe' service, being a frontend service, does not directly interact with a database. Instead, it communicates with backend services responsible for data handling. This separation of concerns adheres to the microservices architecture principles, allowing independent scaling and management of each service component.
