### **Service:** client-fe

### Service Purpose
The client-fe service in the NFFH-client-FE container plays a crucial role in the Not Far(m) From Home platform, which focuses on fostering direct connections between local farmers and consumers. This service is built using Angular, a framework that enables the creation of dynamic client-side applications, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface suitable for the platform’s goals. Its primary function is to provide an engaging and efficient user experience, allowing clients (consumers) to easily navigate through the site, interact with available products, and engage with agricultural companies. This service facilitates various client-focused activities such as registration, login, browsing products, and managing purchases, all within a secure and user-friendly environment. It leverages Angular Material and Bootstrap to offer a visually appealing and intuitive interface, enhancing the overall usability of the platform.

### Key Features
User Interface Development: Utilizes Angular and Angular Material to create a rich and responsive user interface that adjusts to different device screens, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for all users.
User Session Management: Employs ngx-cookie-service for handling browser cookies, which are essential for maintaining user sessions and state across the website. This feature allows clients to experience seamless interaction with the site without needing to repeatedly log in.
Asynchronous Data Handling: Integrates RxJS for managing data flow between the UI components and backend services, ensuring that data updates are handled efficiently without blocking the user interface.
Secure and Persistent Login: Aligns with user stories that emphasize the importance of security and convenience in user authentication, ensuring that clients’ credentials are handled securely while providing an option for session persistence.
Dynamic Content Rendering: Leverages Angular's modular architecture to dynamically render pages based on the user interactions and backend data responses, facilitating a real-time and interactive shopping experience for clients seeking local agricultural products.

### Programming Language, Frameworks and Libraries

- Angular (v16.1.0): A comprehensive framework for building dynamic and complex client-side applications in HTML and TypeScript.
- Angular Material (v16.2.3): Provides a range of UI components that are well-integrated with Angular projects, facilitating the development of visually appealing interfaces.
- Bootstrap (v5.2.3): A widely-used framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites, enhancing the front-end's adaptability across devices.
- RxJS (v7.8.0): A library for asynchronous programming using observable streams, utilized to manage data flow between UI components and backend services effectively.
- ngx-cookie-service (v16.0.1): A service for handling browser cookies, crucial for maintaining session state across client interactions.

### Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns

- The project utilizes Angular's modular structure, organizing code into distinct modules that encapsulate specific functionality, promoting maintainability and testability.
- Angular CLI is employed to scaffold components, services, and other Angular constructs, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.
- Angular Material and Bootstrap are integrated to handle the user interface, demonstrating a blend of custom and pre-designed components for rapid UI development.

### Analysis of the Communication with the Database

- The front-end application does not directly interact with a database but communicates with backend services via API calls to fetch and manipulate data.
- These interactions are typically handled through Angular services, which abstract the HTTP communication logic, ensuring that components are not directly coupled to data management tasks.
- Authentication and session management are facilitated by ngx-cookie-service, leveraging cookies to maintain user session states securely.
