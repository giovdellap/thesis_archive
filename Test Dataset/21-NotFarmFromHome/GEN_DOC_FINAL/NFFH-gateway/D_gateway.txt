### **Service:** gateway

### Service Purpose

The "gateway" service, officially identified as "api-gateway" in the Docker infrastructure, serves as the central access point for the "Not Far(m) From Home" platform, which facilitates interactions between local farmers and consumers. This service is critical in ensuring that all requests from various frontend applications to backend services pass through a singular, secure, and efficiently managed conduit. The gateway's primary role is to aggregate and route API calls to appropriate back-end services, thereby simplifying client interactions with the system's microservices architecture.
The "gateway" service is implemented using Node.js and leverages the Express framework to manage routing and middleware functionalities efficiently. Its design facilitates not only the smooth flow of data but also enforces crucial security measures such as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), making it indispensable for maintaining the integrity and security of interactions within the platform​​​​.

### Key Features
- Routing and Service Aggregation: The gateway consolidates various service APIs into a single endpoint, thereby simplifying the client-side architecture and reducing the complexity of direct communications with multiple backend services.
- Load Balancing: By acting as the primary ingress point for all incoming requests, the gateway effectively distributes traffic to various services, enhancing the system's overall performance and scalability.
- Authentication and Security: The gateway interfaces with the "Auth" service to facilitate secure and authenticated access to the platform. This setup ensures that all requests are authenticated and authorized before reaching the backend services, thereby centralizing security logic and reducing redundancy across services​​​​.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): It incorporates middleware to handle CORS, allowing the platform to securely manage requests from different origins. This feature is crucial for a platform that interacts with various client-side applications.
- Network Management: The service is configured to communicate over multiple Docker-defined networks, connecting with essential backend services such as authentication, client management, and order processing. This network setup ensures isolated and secure communication channels between the gateway and specific services​​.


#### Programming Language, Frameworks and Libraries

- Node.js: Used for building scalable network applications.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- CORS: A package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- http-proxy-middleware: An HTTP proxy middleware for Node.js, which can be used to proxy requests to an underlying server, likely used for routing requests to other services in the system.

#### Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns

- The gateway service is architected as a central API hub within a microservices-oriented environment, using Express to handle routing and middleware functionalities.
- The service is containerized using Docker, indicating a focus on scalability and deployment ease in cloud environments.
- By being connected to multiple other services via Docker networks, it plays a critical role in the system's service-oriented architecture, managing traffic between the client and various back-end services.
