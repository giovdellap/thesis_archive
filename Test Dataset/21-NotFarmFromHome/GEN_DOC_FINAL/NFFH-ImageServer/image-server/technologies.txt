#### Programming Language, Frameworks and Libraries

- Python 3.11.6: Used as the primary programming language.
- Flask 3.0.0: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used to build web applications.
- Gunicorn 21.2.0: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, used to manage the Flask application and serve it on a network.
- PyJWT 1.7.1: A Python library to work with JSON Web Tokens, used for handling authentication tokens.
- Requests 2.31.0: A simple HTTP library for Python, used to send HTTP requests easily.
- Cryptography 41.0.4: Provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers.

#### Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns

- The service is structured around a Flask application, managed and served by Gunicorn as a WSGI server.
- Flaskâ€™s lightweight and modular design allows it to be extended with a variety of add-ons.
- Gunicorn is configured to start with 4 workers, binding to all network interfaces on port 9705, suggesting readiness for production environments.

#### Analysis of the Communication with the Database

- No direct evidence of database communication was found in the Dockerfile or the requirements.txt. Additional source code analysis is required to determine any database interactions.
