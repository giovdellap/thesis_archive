NFFH-gateway Service Description
--------------------------------

Behavior and Purpose:
The NFFH-gateway service, functioning as the api-gateway, is the central entry point for all HTTP requests coming into the "Not Far(M) From Home" application. It is responsible for routing these requests to the appropriate backend services based on the request path, parameters, or headers. This includes handling requests for authentication, user management, farming operations, and order processing. Additionally, the api-gateway plays a crucial role in load balancing, security by potentially implementing authentication and authorization checks, and request logging for monitoring and analytics.

Technologies, Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries:
1. Express.js (version 4.18.2): A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.
2. cors (version 2.8.5): A package for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the api-gateway to manage cross-origin requests efficiently.
3. http-proxy-middleware (version 2.0.6): Facilitates the proxying of requests to other servers, essential for the api-gateway's function of routing requests to various backend services.
