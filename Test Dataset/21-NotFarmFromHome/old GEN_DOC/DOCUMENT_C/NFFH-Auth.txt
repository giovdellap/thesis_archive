SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behavior and the Function It Serves

The NFFH-Auth container is designed to handle authentication across the NFFH system. It's built from a Dockerfile located in the ./app directory, indicating that this service likely contains a custom application dedicated to authentication processes. This container is part of several networks, suggesting it interacts with multiple other services within the system:
- gateway: Likely allows the authentication service to communicate with the system's gateway, indicating its role in authenticating requests entering the system.
- farmer-be: Suggests that the authentication service has direct interactions with the backend services related to farmers.
- client-be: Indicates interactions with the backend services for clients.

This setup points to the NFFH-Auth service being central to securing and managing access to various parts of the system, handling authentication for both client and farmer functionalities.

SECTION 2: List of All the Services Within the Container

- Authentication Service: The main and only service in this container, responsible for handling authentication requests across the NFFH system.

SECTION 3: Table with the Exposed Port and Related Service

The docker-compose.yaml file does not specify any ports, suggesting that this service's communication is internal to the Docker network, with no ports exposed directly to the host.
