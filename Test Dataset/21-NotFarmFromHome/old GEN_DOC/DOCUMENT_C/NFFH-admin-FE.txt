SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behavior and the Function It Serves

The NFFH-admin-FE container is designed to serve the administrative front-end interface for the NFFH system. It operates in two main stages:

1. Build Stage: Utilizes a Node.js environment (specifically, the node:18 image) to build the project. It starts by creating a working directory within the container at /app. The project's package.json files are copied into this directory, and npm install is run to install dependencies. Following this, the entire project source is copied into the container, and npm run build compiles the Angular project.

2. Run Stage: The compiled Angular project is served using Nginx. The Nginx default configuration is replaced with a custom one (nginx.conf), and the compiled project files from /app/dist/admin-fe are copied to the Nginx server's root directory at /usr/share/nginx/html. The container exposes port 80 for HTTP traffic.

SECTION 2: List of All the Services Within the Container

- Nginx Service: Serves the compiled Angular application. It is configured to listen on port 80 inside the container, making it accessible via HTTP.

SECTION 3: Table with the Exposed Port and Related Service

| Exposed Port | Related Service |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 4203         | Nginx Service   |

This setup indicates that the NFFH-admin-FE container is primarily a web server for the administrative front-end, making the admin panel accessible over the network on port 4203, which is mapped to the container's internal port 80 (the standard port for HTTP traffic in Nginx).
