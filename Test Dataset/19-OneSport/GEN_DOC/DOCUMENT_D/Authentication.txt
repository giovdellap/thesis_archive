Authentication Service Description and Technologies
===================================================

Behavior and Purpose:
---------------------
The Authentication service is integral to the OneSport application, handling all aspects of user authentication and authorization. It ensures users can securely access their accounts, manage personal information, and interact with the various services offered by the application. The service provides endpoints for user registration, login, logout, and token validation, crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of user sessions and data.

Technologies, Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries:
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Python: The core programming language used for the development of the Authentication service, known for its readability and versatility.
2. Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, facilitating the creation of web servers and RESTful APIs.
3. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Likely used for creating and managing secure user sessions through tokens. This technology enables the service to authenticate users and authorize access to various parts of the application.
4. SQLAlchemy: Utilized for database operations, acting as an ORM tool that simplifies data manipulation and retrieval, essential for managing user credentials and sessions.
5. Passlib: A library for password hashing and verification, enhancing the security of user passwords by providing robust hashing algorithms.
