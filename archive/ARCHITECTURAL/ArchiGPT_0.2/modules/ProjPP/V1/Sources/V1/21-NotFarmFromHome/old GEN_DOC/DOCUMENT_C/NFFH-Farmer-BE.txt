SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behavior and the Function It Serves

The NFFH-Farmer-BE container is built atop the Java platform, leveraging an openjdk:17 image as its base. It hosts a Spring Boot application (Farmer-BE-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar), which is presumed to manage and facilitate all back-end functionalities required for farmer interactions. This setup suggests the service is tasked with data management, business logic, and API exposure critical to farmer operations within the NFFH system.

A MySQL database service (mysql-farmer) is also defined as part of this container's docker-compose setup, indicating a reliance on a database for persistent data storage. This service uses the mysql:8.0.34 image and is equipped with a dedicated volume for data persistence. It's linked to the farmer-be service through an internal network for isolated communication, ensuring data transactions are securely handled within the system's infrastructure.

SECTION 2: List of All the Services Within the Container

- Farmer-BE Service: The principal service running a Java/Spring Boot application tailored for farmer-related back-end operations.
- MySQL Database (mysql-farmer): A dedicated MySQL database service for the farmer back-end, designed for data storage and management tasks specific to farmer functionalities.

Moreover, the docker-compose configuration suggests integrations with external networks named gateway and auth, hinting at communication pathways with authentication services and potentially a gateway for traffic routing or load balancing. The internal network, as mentioned, facilitates communication strictly between the service and its database.
