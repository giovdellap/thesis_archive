RabbitMQ Service Description

The RabbitMQ service in the 'main-container' acts as the backbone for asynchronous message queuing and distribution across the distributed architecture of the European Parliament Online system. It facilitates efficient, real-time communication and data exchange among EU member nations by managing message dispatching between the organization's workers across various national services. Each nation establishes its own queue on the RabbitMQ broker within this container, which is essential for conducting and managing European referendums and surveys. This setup allows citizen participation in a unified digital platform, enabling the system to leverage a repository of proposals, survey results, and comprehensive data covering all European nations.

Technologies, Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries

1. RabbitMQ: A message broker that enables asynchronous communication, message queuing, and distribution across different components of the system, supporting efficient inter-service communication.
2. Docker: Used for containerization, allowing RabbitMQ and other services to be deployed in an isolated environment, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
3. Spring Boot: Provides the framework for developing microservices that interact with RabbitMQ for message handling and processing, enhancing the system's modularity and scalability.
4. PostgreSQL: As the system's primary database, it interacts with RabbitMQ for data persistence, ensuring data integrity and providing a robust data storage solution for the system's needs.
5. Java: The primary programming language used for developing the system's services, including those that interface with RabbitMQ, leveraging its portability and extensive ecosystem for enterprise applications.
