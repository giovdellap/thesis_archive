SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behavior and the Function It Serves

The NFFH-farmer-FE container is designed for a two-stage build and serve process, focusing on delivering the front-end application for farmers:

1. Build Stage: Utilizes a Node.js environment (node:18 image) to compile the project. It begins by setting up the work directory at /app and proceeds with installing dependencies as specified in package*.json. Subsequently, the project's source code is copied and npm run build is executed to compile the Angular project.

2. Run Stage: The compiled assets are served using Nginx. The default Nginx configuration is replaced with a customized one (nginx.conf), and the built project from /app/dist/farmer-fe is placed in the Nginx server's root at /usr/share/nginx/html. The container is set to expose port 80, aligning with the HTTP standard.

SECTION 2: List of All the Services Within the Container

- Nginx Service: Dedicated to serving the compiled front-end assets. It listens on port 80 internally, aligning with web service conventions.

SECTION 3: Table with the Exposed Port and Related Service

| Exposed Port | Related Service |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 4202         | Nginx Service   |

This setup indicates that the NFFH-farmer-FE container's main role is to present the farmer-side user interface of the NFFH system, making it available over the network on port 4202. This port is mapped to the container's internal Nginx server port 80.
