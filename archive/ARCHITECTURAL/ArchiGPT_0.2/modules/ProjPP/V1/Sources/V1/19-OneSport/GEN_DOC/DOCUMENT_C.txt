SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behaviour and Function
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The "single-container" system, named OneSport, is a multi-functional web application dedicated to offering up-to-date and pertinent information on a wide range of sports and athletic events. Its primary aim is to keep sports fans and enthusiasts well-informed and engaged, serving as a one-stop destination for comprehensive sports news, event updates, and a convenient platform for social interactions among users. The system encapsulates several services, including:

- News: Provides the latest news and updates on various sports.
- Authentication: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- Tickets: Offers a ticketing system for events.
- Friends: Facilitates social features allowing users to connect and interact.
- Frontend: Serves the user interface where users can access news, buy tickets, and interact with other fans.

These services are orchestrated through Docker Compose, highlighting a microservices architecture approach. Although termed "single-container", it efficiently utilizes multiple containers to segregate responsibilities, ensuring modularity and scalability.
