### **Service:** farmer-fe

### Service Purpose
The "farmer-fe" service, as part of the "farmer-FE" container, serves as the frontend interface for agricultural companies within the "Not Far(m) From Home" platform. Its primary purpose is to facilitate a user-friendly, interactive web environment where agricultural companies can manage their presence on the platform. This service utilizes Angular for its frontend development, ensuring a robust, modular structure that supports reusability and maintainability of components. Through this service, agricultural companies can register, log in, and manage their product listings, which include adding, removing, and modifying products in their inventory. It acts as a bridge between the local farmers and consumers by providing a platform for farmers to display and update their fresh produce available for consumer reservations and pick-up.

### Key Features
The "farmer-fe" service offers several key features crucial for its operation and the overall user experience on the platform:
- User Authentication and Session Management: Utilizing Node.js, the service facilitates registration, login, and session management for agricultural companies, ensuring that sessions persist across reloads, which enhances usability and security.
- Dynamic Content Management: Through Angular's reactive programming model, the service can dynamically update the user interface in response to user interactions and data changes, providing real-time feedback and updates without page reloads.
- Interactive UI Components: The service includes various interactive components such as forms for registration and login, product management interfaces, and customizable views for displaying products, all designed to be responsive and intuitive.
- API Integration: It interacts with backend services through defined APIs to fetch and send data, ensuring seamless data flow between the frontend and the backend parts of the platform, and thus maintaining data integrity and application performance.
- Security and Data Isolation: The service is designed with security in mind, ensuring that data interactions are handled through secure APIs and that the frontend does not directly interact with the database, minimizing security risks associated with direct database exposure.

### Programming Language, Frameworks and Libraries

- JavaScript (ECMAScript compatible)
- Node.js 18: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Angular: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
- NPM: A package manager for JavaScript, used to manage application dependencies.
- Nginx: A web server used to serve the static files of the Angular application in a production environment.

### Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns

- The service utilizes Angular for frontend development, following typical Angular project structures including components, services, and modules.
- The application is containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments.
- Nginx is configured to serve the static content generated by the Angular build process, which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- The Dockerfile includes multi-stage builds: one stage for building the Angular application using Node.js and another for running it using Nginx, optimizing the final image size and security.

### Analysis of the Communication with the Database

- This frontend service does not directly interact with any database. All interactions with data are expected to occur through API calls to backend services, which manage data persistence and business logic.
- This separation of concerns enhances security by minimizing direct exposure of the database to the client-side environment and simplifies scalability by allowing independent scaling of frontend and backend components.
