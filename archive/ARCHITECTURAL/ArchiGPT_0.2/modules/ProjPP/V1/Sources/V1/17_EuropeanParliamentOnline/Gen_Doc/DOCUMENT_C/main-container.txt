### SECTION 1: Container Overview
The `main-container` is dedicated to handling asynchronous communication across the system's distributed architecture, specifically through the RabbitMQ message broker. This container is crucial for managing message dispatching between the organization's workers across various national services. Each nation within the system—illustrated through the deployment of specific containers for Italy, France, and Germany—establishes its own queue on the RabbitMQ broker within this main container, enabling efficient, real-time communication and data exchange among EU member nations. This setup facilitates the core functionality of the system: to conduct and manage European referendums and surveys, allowing citizen participation in a unified digital platform.

### SECTION 2: Services in the Container
- **RabbitMQ**: This service enables asynchronous message queuing and distribution across different components of the system, allowing for efficient communication between services deployed for various nations.
