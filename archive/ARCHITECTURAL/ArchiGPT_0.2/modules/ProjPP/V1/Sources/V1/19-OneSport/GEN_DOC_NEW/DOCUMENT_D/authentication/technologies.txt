1) Programming Language, Frameworks, and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks:
    Flask (2.3.2) - A micro web framework for Python used for handling web requests.
Libraries:
    Flask-CORS (4.0.0) - Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
    Flask-SQLAlchemy (3.0.5) - An ORM extension for Flask that interacts with databases.
    Flask-Login (0.6.2) - Manages user session management for Flask.
    Flask-JWT-Extended - Adds support for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Flask for authentication.
    psycopg2 (2.9.7) - PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
    python-dotenv (1.0.0) - Reads key-value pairs from a .env file and sets them as environment variables.
    Werkzeug (2.3.6) - A comprehensive WSGI web application library.

2) Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns
The service is structured following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with separate directories for controllers, models, and routes. The application is containerized using Docker.

3) Communication with the Database
Flask-SQLAlchemy is used for ORM-based database interactions, with psycopg2 enabling communication with PostgreSQL.

4) Communication with Other Services and the Final User
Flask creates RESTful endpoints for HTTP request and response handling, facilitating communication between the front-end and the server. JWT is used for secure, stateless authentication between clients and services.
