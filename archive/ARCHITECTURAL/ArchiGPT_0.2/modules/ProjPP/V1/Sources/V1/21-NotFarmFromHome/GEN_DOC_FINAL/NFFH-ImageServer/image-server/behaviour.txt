### Key Features
Key features of the image-server service include its ability to handle image uploads and retrievals efficiently using a web-based interface. The service provides an endpoint /images/<role>/upload for uploading images where users can send images as base64 encoded JSON objects. This feature is essential for users who need to upload pictures of their products or profile images. Upon successful upload, the service responds with a URL JSON object, providing a link to the uploaded image​​. Another significant feature is the retrieval functionality, accessible through the endpoint /images/<role>/<image_filename>. This feature allows users to access images directly via a simple GET request, facilitating easy integration with the front-end user interfaces where images are displayed. These features support the platform's goal of enabling farmers to showcase their products visually and consumers to view these products, enhancing the overall user experience on the platform.
