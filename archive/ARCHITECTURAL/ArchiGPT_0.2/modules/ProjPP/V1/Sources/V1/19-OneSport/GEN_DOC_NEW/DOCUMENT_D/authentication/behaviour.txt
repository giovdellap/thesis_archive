Service Purpose

The "authentication" service within the OneSport platform serves as the critical component managing user authentication and session management. This service ensures that users can securely create accounts, log in, and manage their sessions, which is pivotal for maintaining the integrity and privacy of user data. Utilizing Flask-JWT-Extended, the service offers robust mechanisms for handling JSON Web Tokens, which facilitate secure and stateless interactions between the client and the server. This is essential not only for operational security but also for ensuring that user interactions with the platform remain seamless and secure, whether they are browsing news, managing profiles, or purchasing tickets.

Key Features

User Account Management: Supports operations such as user account creation, login, and logout, alongside editing user details and deleting accounts. This is facilitated by a range of endpoints handling specific data inputs and generating corresponding responses, such as LoginInput and LogoutResponse.
Session Management: Utilizes Flask-Login for handling user sessions, critical for maintaining user state across different interactions with the application during a session.
Security Features: Implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication which enhances security by ensuring that each request from a client is verified for authenticity before being processed.
Scalable User Validation: Offers endpoints like /checkToken to validate session tokens, ensuring that the user's sessions remain valid and secure throughout their interaction with the platform.
RESTful API Interface: Designed with Flask, the service includes a well-defined RESTful API for handling requests and responses, making it efficient for front-end services to communicate with the authentication module.
