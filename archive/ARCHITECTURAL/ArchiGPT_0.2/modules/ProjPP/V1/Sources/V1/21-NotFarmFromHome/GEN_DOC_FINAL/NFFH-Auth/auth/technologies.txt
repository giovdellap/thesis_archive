### Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns

- The service is structured around a Flask application, managed and served by Gunicorn as a WSGI server.
- Flaskâ€™s lightweight and modular design allows it to be extended with a variety of add-ons.
- Gunicorn is configured to start with 4 workers, binding to all network interfaces on port 9701, suggesting readiness for production environments.
