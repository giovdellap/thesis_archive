SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behavior and the Function It Serves

The NFFH-ImageServer is specifically set up to handle image storage, retrieval, and possibly manipulation tasks for the NFFH system. It utilizes a custom Dockerfile located within the ./app directory for its setup, indicating that it likely runs a specialized service for managing image data.

This service is connected to the gateway network, suggesting that it interacts with the API gateway for routing requests. The inclusion of a volume (image-server-data) mapped to /app/uploads within the container points to the persistence of image files, allowing for efficient storage and access to uploaded images.

SECTION 2: List of All the Services Within the Container

- Image Server Service: The primary and only service in this container, dedicated to managing image files. This could include functionalities like uploading, storing, processing, and serving image files to other services or directly to clients.

SECTION 3: Table with the Exposed Port and Related Service

The docker-compose.yaml file does not specify any externally exposed ports for direct access, suggesting that access to the image server is managed internally within the system, likely through the API gateway.

Given this setup, the NFFH-ImageServer plays a critical role in managing image-related functionalities, ensuring that the system can handle image files efficiently and securely.
