#### Programming Language, Frameworks and Libraries

- Node.js: Used for building scalable network applications.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- CORS: A package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- http-proxy-middleware: An HTTP proxy middleware for Node.js, which can be used to proxy requests to an underlying server, likely used for routing requests to other services in the system.

#### Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns

- The gateway service is architected as a central API hub within a microservices-oriented environment, using Express to handle routing and middleware functionalities.
- The service is containerized using Docker, indicating a focus on scalability and deployment ease in cloud environments.
- By being connected to multiple other services via Docker networks, it plays a critical role in the system's service-oriented architecture, managing traffic between the client and various back-end services.
