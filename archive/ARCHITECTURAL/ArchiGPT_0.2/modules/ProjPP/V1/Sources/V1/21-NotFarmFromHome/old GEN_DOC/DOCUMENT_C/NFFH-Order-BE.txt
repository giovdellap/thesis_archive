SECTION 1: Textual Description of the Container's Behavior and the Function It Serves

The NFFH-Order-BE container is built on the Java platform, using an openjdk:17 image. It runs a Spring Boot application (Order-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar), which is designed to handle all backend logic related to orders within the system. This includes managing order creation, processing, and tracking functionalities.

The service is coupled with a MySQL database (mysql-order), suggesting a reliance on persistent data storage for managing order information. The database service uses the mysql:8.0.34 image, with a dedicated volume for data persistence. It is connected to the order-be service via an internal network, indicating isolated communication for data handling.

SECTION 2: List of All the Services Within the Container

- Order-BE Service: The main service running a Java/Spring Boot application for order management tasks.
- MySQL Database (mysql-order): A MySQL database service specifically configured for the order back-end, providing data storage and management for order-related operations.
