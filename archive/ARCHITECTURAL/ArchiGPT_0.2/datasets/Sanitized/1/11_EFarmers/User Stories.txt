DESCRIPTION:

E-Farmers is an e-commerce website that aims to connect local farmers with customers who are interested in
buying fresh and locally sourced products. Our platform allows farmers to showcase their products by publishing
insertions, while customers can easily browse and purchase these goods. Whether you are a farmer looking
to sell your products or a customers seeking high-quality ”farm-to-table” items, E-Farmers has something for
everyone. Moreover, if you cannot reach the farmer’s warehouse yourself, you can rely on riders who can ship
the products to your home
