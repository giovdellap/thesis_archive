DESCRIPTION:

The GetYourAssistant system is a versatile architecture that allows users to obtain assistance from the organization they wish to contact.
The system is designed to enable the organization's workers to receive and process requests, while also providing specific attention to supervisors, who can design system improvements based on real-time statistics.
Users can also view statistics about the system's overall performance and manage their time accordingly.
